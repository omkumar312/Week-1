ðŸ”¹ Key Updates in Week 2

- Data Preparation

1. Cleaned raw dataset and fixed missing/inconsistent values

2. Converted categorical variables into numerical form

3. Scaled features for better model convergence

4. Split data into training and testing sets

- Model Training

1. Implemented multiple ML models for comparison

2. Evaluated accuracy during training phase

3. Saved the best-performing model for deployment (model.pkl)

- Backend Development (New)
